# Data Representation & Querying Project 2024

This project relies on the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack.

Allowing a user to add entries to a remote mongoDB database and retrieve and display all entries from said database. The user can also update entries and delete entries from the databse. 

 I used react bootstrap for the styling and theming.
